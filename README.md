# CSII-3rd-Assignment
This repository contains the solutions for the third assignment of the CS-II course with professor Marco Zecchini at University of Rome "La Sapienza".

The repository includes seven problems from ROSALIND, three exercises utilizing Map Reduce and one exercise using Biopython, all organized into a Jupyter Notebook file.
It's structured as follows:

# Bioinformatics Stronghold
From Bioinformatics Stronghold: lgis, sseq, lcsq, edit, edta, ctea, glob.

The corresponding datasets can be found in the "bs-datasets" folder.

# Map Reduce 
Three exercises where you have to use map, filter and reduce to achieve the results.

# Biopython
One exercise in which you have to write five functions to analyze global alignments between two sequences using Biopython's pairwise2 module.

The corresponding datasets can be found in the "biopython-datasets" folder.
